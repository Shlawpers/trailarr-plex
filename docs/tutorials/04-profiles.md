# Profiles

Once the basic Trailarr configuration is done, it's time to look at **Profiles**.

Profiles define the settings for trailers (like quality, language, etc.) and include filters that determine when each profile will be applied to your media. For example, you might want different trailer settings for movies than for TV series, or different settings for animated movies compared to live-action ones.

Trailarr comes with two default profiles to get you started:

1.  **Movies:** A pre-configured profile tailored for movies.
2.  **Series:** A pre-configured profile tailored for TV series.

You can:
*   **Use the default profiles:** For many users, the default profiles will work well out-of-the-box.
*   **Edit the default profiles:** Navigate to `Settings > Profiles`, select a profile, and click `Edit` to customize its trailer settings and application filters.
*   **Create new profiles:** If you have more specific needs, you can create entirely new profiles from scratch by clicking the `Add New Profile` button in `Settings > Profiles`.

Review the default profiles and consider if they meet your needs. If not, adjust them or create new ones before proceeding to set up your connections. The profiles available here will be selectable when you configure your Radarr and Sonarr connections.
