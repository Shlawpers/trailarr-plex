# Configuration

Once Trailarr is installed and running, it's time to perform the initial configuration.

1.  **Access Trailarr:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to Trailarr. If you installed it on the same machine you're using, this will typically be `http://localhost:7889` (or whichever host port you mapped during installation).

2.  **Initial Login:**
    You will be greeted with a login screen.
    *   Default Username: `admin`
    *   Default Password: `admin`
    Enter these credentials and click `Login`.

3.  **Change Login Credentials:**
    For security, it's highly recommended to change the default username and password immediately.

    *   Navigate to `Settings` in the sidebar.
    *   Go to the `About` tab within Settings.
    *   Click the `Update Login` button.
    *   A dialog will appear allowing you to set a new username and/or a new password.

        !!! tip 
            You can leave the username/password blank if you only want to change one of them.
        
    *   Enter your desired new credentials and click `Save`. You may be logged out and asked to log in again with your new credentials.

4.  **Update General Settings:**
    After updating your login, review and adjust other application settings.
    *   Navigate to `Settings` in the sidebar.
    *   Go to the `General` tab.
    *   Here you can configure various options according to your preferences. Review each setting carefully.
    *   Once you've made your changes, click `Save` at the bottom of the page to apply them.

With these initial configuration steps completed, you're ready to move on to setting up Profiles and Connections.
