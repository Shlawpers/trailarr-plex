ðŸš§ Under Construction... ðŸš§


There is an Unraid template for Trailarr maintained by [JPDVM2014](https://github.com/JPDVM2014) that you can use. It's pretty well maintained, for help with the template specifically related to Unraid, you can ask [here](https://forums.unraid.net/topic/122788-support-jpdvm2014-templates/)!

We don't have a guide for this yet! But there is a video by [AlienTech42](https://www.youtube.com/@AlienTech42) on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz31zWEtY5k&t=8s&pp=ygUOdHJhaWxhcnIgc2V0dXA%3D) that explains Trailarr installation and setup on Unraid.

Now that Trailarr is up and running, we need to configure it to connect to our `Radarr` and `Sonarr` to let it start doing it's job - download trailers. We will go over that in the next section [Setup](../03-setup/index.md).
