!!! tip "Enable Debug Logging for Detailed Troubleshooting"
    When actively trying to diagnose a complex issue, temporarily setting the application's [Log Level to `Debug`](../settings/general-settings/index.md#log-level) in the General Settings can provide much more detailed operational information. Remember to set it back to a less verbose level (like `Info` or `Warning`) afterwards to prevent excessive log file growth and performance impact.
