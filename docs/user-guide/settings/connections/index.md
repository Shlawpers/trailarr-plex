!!! tip
    _If you have a huge library and don't want to download trailers for all of them, set the monitor type to `None` when adding a Radarr/Sonarr Connection. Wait for an hour or so to let the app sync all media from that connection, and change it to `New` to download trailers for new media. You can always manually set the monitor type for the movies/series you want to download trailers for._
