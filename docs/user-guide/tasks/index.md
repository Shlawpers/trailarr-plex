# Tasks

The Tasks page shows all background jobs that keep Trailarr running smoothly. You can view scheduled jobs, see their status, and run them manually if needed.

## Scheduled Tasks

### **Arr Data Refresh**

- Runs every 60 minutes (first run starts 30 seconds after app launch) (configurable in [Settings > General > Monitor Interval](../settings/general-settings/index.md#monitor-interval)).
- Connects to all Radarr and Sonarr connections to sync media items and their status in Trailarr.
- Applies `Monitor` and `Status` values, and scans for trailers for new items.
- Runs as a background job; first run starts 30 seconds after app launch.
- If the task is already running, a new instance will not start until the previous one finishes.

### **Docker Update Check**

- Runs once a day (first run starts 4 minutes after app launch).
- Checks if a new Docker image is available for Trailarr and notifies in the UI/logs.
- Does not auto-update; you must update the container manually.

### **Scan Disk for Trailers**

- Runs every 60 minutes (same as Arr Data Refresh; first run starts 8 minutes after app launch).
- Scans your media folders for trailers and updates the database with found trailers.
- Useful if you add/delete trailers manually or outside of Trailarr.

### **Download Missing Trailers**

- Runs every 60 minutes (same as Arr Data Refresh; first run starts 15 minutes after app launch).
- Downloads trailers for media that are missing them, based on your profiles and filters.
- Uses yt-dlp and ffmpeg for downloading and conversion.
- There is a delay between consecutive trailer downloads. The delays are as follows:

    | Download No | Delay     |
    |:-----------:|:---------:|
    | 1 - 9       | 2 mins    |
    | 10 - 49     | 4 mins    |
    | 50 - 99     | 6 mins    |
    | 100 - 199   | 7 mins    |
    | 200 - 499   | 9 mins    |
    | 1000+       | 10 mins   |

    All delays also includes an extra random time between `0 - 60` seconds.

### **Image Refresh**

- Runs every 6 hours (first run starts 12 minutes after app launch).
- Updates artwork and images for your media library.
- Ensures posters, backgrounds, and other images are up to date.

### **Trailer Cleanup**

- Runs once a day (first run starts 4 hours after app launch).
- Cleans up broken, incomplete, or audio-less trailers from your library.
- Helps keep your storage clean and avoids playback issues.

## Queued Tasks

You can see queued/running jobs and their progress in real time.

!!! tip
    You might sometimes see an error in logs like below and it's normal behaviour. All the tasks are setup such that if that task is already running, it won't start a new one!
